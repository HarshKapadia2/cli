# Windows Command Prompt (cmd)

-   **Shorthands**
    -   cmd = Windows Command Prompt
    -   cwd = current working directory

## Open cmd

-   Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.
-   Type in `cmd` and press enter!

OR

-   Search for `cmd` in the start menu.
-   Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for a standard command prompt and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> for an Administrator command prompt.

OR

-   Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>.
-   Then, press <kbd>C</kbd> for a standard command prompt and <kbd>A</kbd> for an Administrator command prompt.

## Current working directory (cwd)

-   The location in the file system to which the cmd is currently pointing to.
-   Eg: `C:\Users\user_name>`
-   The `cd` command without any arguments will print the current directory.
-   The full path to the current directory is stored in the `%cd%` variable.

## Keyboard shortcuts

-   Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to complete file & directory names and to further iterate over files. This can be done after partially typing out the name as well. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to go back to the previous names.
-   Pressing the <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> gives you all the commands previously executed in that instance of the cmd, one by one. The <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> can be used to go towards the recent commands.
-   Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>&#8592;</kbd>/<kbd>&#8594;</kbd> to jump words.
-   Use <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> keys to jump to the beginning and end of the line respectively.

## Help for any command

-   `<command> /?` brings up a brief overview of what the command does and the options/flags that can be used with it, eg: `dir /?`.

## Clear screen & command history

-   Use `cls` to clear the screen of the cmd.

## Stop running processes

-   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> will stop running processes (like Node.js servers, etc) in your terminal and bring back the prompt (the cwd text on the command line).

## Changing directories

-   `cd <dir_name_or_relative/path/to/dir>` to change directory.
-   To go up by one level (ie, to the parent directory), use `cd ..`.
-   `cd ..\..` to go up 2 directories at one time.
-   Use tab to auto-complete file and folder names.
-   `cd \` to go to root dir.
-   To change to a different drive `drive_name:`, eg: `C:`.
-   Using absolute path:
    -   `cd drive_name:\dir_1\dir_2`
    -   Works only in the same drive. Switch to the particular drive to use the absolute path.

## Run files on cmd

-   Go the the directory and type `file_name.ext`.
-   cmd uses the default program for that file type to open the file.

## Path variable

-   Type `path` to view the contents of the system and user path variables.
-   It stores the (absolute) path (ie, directory) to certain executable files/programs.
-   This helps in executing programs without going to the directory in which the executable file of the program exists.
-   When a program name is typed, the cwd is checked for the executable and if it is not found, the path variable dirs are checked. If not found, an error `'program_name' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.` is thrown.
-   As the path variable has absolute paths, the executable name can be typed at any location that the cwd points to.
-   Use `set path="%path%;absolute/path/to/exe_dir"` to set path temporarily for an instance of the cmd.  
    Note the `%path%`, because omitting it will overwrite the `path`. Overwriting the `path` with `set path="path/to/file"` is usually a bad idea, as you will be unable to use most standard commands like `more`.
-   GUI: Search for `env` in the start menu and click on the `environment variables` button to view and edit all environment variables.

## Listing files, directories, drives and directory structure

-   `dir` to list all files and directories in the cwd (current working directory).
-   `dir path\to\dir` to view files in another directory without changing the cwd. (Use `""` if command doesn't work.)
-   `dir /a` to llist hidden dirs as well.
-   `dir file_name.ext` lists only that file.
-   To list all files of a certain extension `dir *.ext`.
-   Listing all available drives `wmic logicaldisk get name`.
-   `tree` to view directory structure. `tree /f` to view files as well as directories.
-   `tree /f /a > file_name.txt` to output the tree (file structure) to a file (`file_name.txt`).

## Creating directories

-   `md dir_name` will create a folder in the cwd, if the `dir_name` doesn't already exist in the cwd.
-   Use `""` if the `dir_name` has spaces, eg: `md "dir name"`.
-   Multiple folders can be created using `md dir_1 dir_2`.

## Deleting directories

-   **This will permanently delete your files.** They will not be found in the 'Recycle Bin'.
-   `rmdir dir_name` will delete the folder from the cwd, **if it is empty**.
-   `rmdir /s dir_name` will delete the folder and it's contents from the cwd.
-   Use `""` if the `dir_name` has spaces, eg: `rmdir "dir name"`.
-   Multiple folders can be deleted using `rmdir dir_1 dir_2`.

## Creating files

-   Use `type nul > file_name.ext` to create an empty file in the cwd.
-   Use `echo "enter text here" > file_name.ext` to create a file with data in it.

OR

-   Use `copy con file_name.ext` to create a file. It will wait for input. Enter the input and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> and then the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key when done with the input.

OR

-   Use `echo. > file_name.ext` to create an empty file. Note that there is no space between `echo` and `.`.

## The `find` command

-   The `find` command will look for a word/phrase in a file or folder.  
    Eg: `find "Hello" hello.txt` will print all the lines with the word `Hello` in the file `hello.txt`.
-   By default, the text is case sensitive (`Hello` is different from `hello`). Use the `/i` flag to ignore case.  
    Eg: `find /i "Hello" hello.txt`.
-   You can also tell it to search all the files in the current folder with `find "Hello" *`, or another folder with `find "Hello" text\*`.

## Redirecting output

### Redirect to a file

-   To redirect the output of a command to a file, use the `>` symbol.
    Eg: `dir > files.txt` will save the output of the `dir` command to a file named `files.txt`.  
    Note that if `files.txt` already had some data, then this will **overwrite** the old data.
-   To write to an existing file, use the `>>` symbol.
    Eg: `dir >> files.txt` will append the output of the `dir` command to a file named `files.txt`.  
    You can check this by running the command twice, and then viewing the contents of the file with `more files.txt`.
-   You can use this to create a file with some content with `echo "Hello, world" > hello.txt`.

### Redirect to another command

-   Sometimes, it can be useful to use the output of one command as the input to another command. This can be achieved using **pipes**.
-   A pipe is created using the pip character (`|`).
-   Eg: To list all the `.txt` files in the current directory, use `dir | find ".txt"`.

## Editing a file

-   Vim editor works in cmd. Note that Vim is **not** installed in Windows by default. You can [install Vim from here](https://www.vim.org/download.php).
-   Run `vim file_name.ext` to start the editor in the cmd itself.
-   Run `vimtutor` for an interactive tutorial on how to use Vim.
-   Online documentation can be found [here](https://vimhelp.org/).
-   Find Vim commands [here](https://cognitivewaves.wordpress.com/vi-editor/).

## Reading file content

-   `type file_name.ext` prints out the contents of the file.
-   `more file_name.ext` prints out the contents, but pauses after every page.

## Copying and moving files

NOTE: Use `""` for absolute paths.

-   `xcopy file_name.ext/source_dir destination_dir` to copy the file/all the files in a folder (`source_dir`) to the `destination_dir`. This only copies the files in the `source_dir`, not the sub-dirs.
-   To copy all files AND sub-dirs (except empty ones) of a folder (`source_dir`) to the `destination_dir`, use `xcopy source_dir destination_dir /s`.

OR

-   `copy file_to_be_copied.ext destination_dir_path` to copy the file to the `destination_dir`.
-   `move file.ext/source_dir destination_dir` to move files or dirs.

## Renaming files

-   `ren <source_file.ext/source_dir_name> <new_file_name.ext/new_dir_name>` to rename a file or a dir.

## Deleting a file

-   `del file_name.txt` **permanently** deletes the file from the cwd.

## File attributes

-   Attributes include 'archived', 'hidden', 'system', etc.
-   `attrib /?` for overview.
-   Go to directory and type `attrib` to view the attributes of the files in it.
-   Adding attributes, eg: `attrib -h +r file_name.txt`.

## Background and text color

-   `color bt` (b = background color, t = text color)
-   For color legend, type `color /?`.
-   Type `color` to reset all colors to default.

## Chaining commands

-   You can chain multiple commands using `&`, `&&` and `||`.
-   `command_1 & command_2` will run `command_1` and then run `command_2`.
-   `command_1 && command_2` will run `command_1` and then run `command_2` only if `command_1` finished successfully.
-   `command_1 || command_2` will run `command_1` and then run `command_2` only if `command_1` **did not** finish successfully.
-   Running `echo ^G` (Typed as `echo `, then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>) will cause a beep sound.
-   A useful trick is to add `& echo ^G` after a command that you know will take a long time to complete. You can go do something else and this will alert you when the command finishes.
